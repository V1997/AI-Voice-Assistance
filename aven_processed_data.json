You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate, with a 2.5% transfer fee. Checking your offer does not affect your credit score; a hard credit check is performed only when you finalize with a notary.

    "content": "This document is a consumer handbook on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It explains that an ARM is a mortgage with an interest rate that can change, potentially leading to higher monthly payments. The handbook advises consumers to consider an ARM only if they can afford the maximum possible payment. It compares ARMs with fixed-rate mortgages, detailing that an ARMs interest rate is composed of an index and a margin. The document guides readers on how to use their Loan Estimate to understand the terms, including the initial interest rate, how often it can change, and its maximum limit. It also explains the Adjustable Interest Rate (AIR) table, which details the calculation of interest rate changes. The booklet warns about potential risks such as teaser rates, paying points to temporarily reduce the rate, interest-only ARMs where the principal balance isnt paid down initially, and payment-option ARMs that can lead to negative amortization. It encourages consumers to shop around, ask lenders specific questions, and consider if an ARM fits their financial situation.",

It explains how to use the booklet to understand your options. A HELOC is a line of credit where you can borrow, spend, and repay as you go, with your home as collateral. The booklet advises considering a HELOC only if you are confident in your ability to make payments, as failure to do so could result in losing your home. It compares HELOCs to other financial sources like second mortgages, cash-out refinances, personal lines of credit, retirement plan loans, and credit cards, detailing their pros and cons. The guide outlines the mechanics of a HELOC, including up-front costs, the draw period for borrowing, and the repayment period, which might conclude with a balloon payment. It also discusses how variable interest rates work, typically composed of an index and a margin. The document highlights consumer rights, such as required disclosures from lenders and the three-day right to cancel the credit line. It also notes that lenders can freeze or reduce the credit line if the homes value drops or the borrowers financial situation changes. The booklet encourages consumers to shop around and compare at least three HELOC offers.",
